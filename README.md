— My old tech lead

📈 Executive Summary

This repository represents a strategic initiative to leverage holiday-themed problem-solving opportunities and enhance developer synergy across time zones.

In short: I’m doing Advent of Code again, in Java, because nothing says “Christmas spirit” like a 400-line class just to parse a text file.

🧠 Vision Statement

To architect and deploy high-quality, enterprise-ready solutions to whimsical algorithmic challenges, while adhering to industry best practices, SOLID principles, and the comforting illusion of productivity.

☕ Java 25 (i wont get the new questions wrong anymore)

🧑‍💻 Gradle (to feel professional while solving puzzles about elves)

🧩 JUnit 5 (testing everywhere but not here)

💬 Logging (for spiritual debugging)
